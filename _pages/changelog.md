It's been around 7 months since the lat­est up­date and let me tell you : I've been hard at work!
This new ver­sion is packed with lots of new fea­tures, im­prove­ments, sys­tem in­te­gra­tions and so much more!

### **What's new**

The app is now ready to run on big­ger screens… and it looks amaz­ing! 

• **Re­designed Movie Sum­ma­ry**  
The view has been re­designed from the ground up and now fea­tures even more info about your movies in­clud­ing the new sec­tions trail­ers, about, rat­ings and in­for­ma­tion sec­tions.

• **Movie rat­ing**  
You can now rate your fa­vorite movies with Pop­corn­Movies.

• **New share sheet style ac­tions**  
The main ac­tions you can per­form have been im­proved and you can now choose to or­ga­nize them as.y­ou.­like!

• **SF Sym­bols and Ac­cent col­or**  
The app fea­tures a brand new ac­cent col­or and all pre­vi­ous­ly used icons have been re­placed with SF Sym­bols.

• **Dy­nam­ic Type**  
Thanks to Dy­nam­ic Type, all the app will now fol­low your pre­ferred text size and adapt ac­cord­ing­ly to be more ac­ces­si­ble than be­fore. 

• **Movie shar­ing**  
You can now share this movie you like so much to any­one and if they have the app al­ready in­stalled, it'll open its sum­ma­ry right away!

You can now search spe­cif­ic items in your Watch­list, His­to­ry and Col­lec­tion by ti­tle or genre.

• **New Watch­list ban­ner style**  
All movies match­ing the cur­rent year will now dis­play a bit more in­for­ma­tion wether they’re re­leased or not. If they are not re­leased yet, you will now have a bet­ter idea how long you need to wait.

• **User Pro­file**  
Your pro­file has been re­designed too, and it dis­plays your in­for­ma­tion way more el­e­gant­ly.. go check it out!

• The pre­vi­ous Quick­sand font has been re­placed in fa­vor of SF Round­ed to sup­port more dy­nam­ic sizes and take full ad­van­tage of dy­nam­ic type.
